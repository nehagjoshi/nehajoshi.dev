      <description>Let us start by asking a simple question:
What is a Device Driver?
If I were to put a definition together for a device driver, I would say, its the brain of any hardware. Telling the body (hardware) what to do, telling the world (operation system), what the body is capable of. Quite literally, if the device driver malfunctions, or is not present at all, then the device is as good as dead, unusable.</description>

      <description>Let us give a simple thought to this question:
 &amp;ldquo;How many times have you debugged some issue today?&amp;rdquo;
 You would be surprised that the number will be quite large than what you had initially expected. Debugging is such an important skill to possess.
May it be:  -The setup which is not working -Unable to connect to Zoom meetings (this has become a new way of working in this quarantine period) -VNC session not getting connected -Bluetooth not getting connected to the speaker  And countless other experiences!</description>
