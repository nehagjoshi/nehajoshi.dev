      <description>Let us give a simple thought to this question:
 &amp;ldquo;How many times have you debugged some issue today?&amp;rdquo;
 You would be surprised that the number will be quite large than what you had initially expected. Debugging is such an important skill to possess.
May it be:  -The setup which is not working -Unable to connect to Zoom meetings (this has become a new way of working in this quarantine period) -VNC session not getting connected -Bluetooth not getting connected to the speaker  And countless other experiences!</description>
