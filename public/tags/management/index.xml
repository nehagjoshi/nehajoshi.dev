      <description>I came across this amazing Udemy course by Chris Croft. I am not into managerial role. But I wanted to have knowledge about the essentials of leadership. So I took up this course and I was very impressed by all the points which were put across during the course. Sharing some points which I had taken while persuing the course. I hope you find it useful :)
Leadership skills: leader vs manager  [-] Leader more about getting things done [-] Manager more about motivation and knowing what ppl wants etc.</description>
