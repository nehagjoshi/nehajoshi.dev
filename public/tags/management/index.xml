      <description>I came across this amazing Udemy course by Chris Croft: &amp;ldquo;Leadership: Practical Leadership Skills&amp;rdquo;. I am not into a managerial role. But I wanted to have knowledge about the essentials of leadership. So I took up this course and I was very impressed by all the points which were put across during the course. Sharing some points which I had taken while pursuing the course. I hope you find it useful :)</description>
