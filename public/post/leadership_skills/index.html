<h4 id="1-analytical-1">[1] Analytical:</h4>
<ul>
<li>|==== (1) Very fair boss and a good communicator.</li>
<li>|==== (2) Not a natural communicator.</li>
<li>|==== (3) More of a 1To1 communicator.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>[-] Mostly No</li>
<li>[-] Self-actualization and status has nothing to do with money, even though it may bring security</li>
<li>[-] Money is a push motivator, not a pull motivator. i.e. It will make you do things, but will not make you want to do things</li>
<li>[-] Below a point it works</li>
<li>[-] Pay increase has only a short term effect. It makes an individual think that they got it just because they must be doing a good job.</li>
<li>[-] Praise + Money is more effective than just Money</li>
<li>[-] For creative tasks, more money == Less output. Thats because money distracts you from the task. It replaces the motivation.</li>
<li>[-] Money matters are always unfair</li>
<li>[-] Better to motivate people with other factors than Money</li>
<li>[-] Worth thinking: Will you do a better job at work if you are silently paid more?</li>
<li>|==== YES: That means you are not performing your best currently</li>
<li>|==== NO : That means money is not a motivator for you</li>
