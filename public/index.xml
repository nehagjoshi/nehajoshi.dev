      <description>Hello There! Firstly, thanks for visiting my site. This is something which I was planning to do since a very long time. Finally this lockdown due to &amp;ldquo;Covid-19&amp;rdquo; has helped me gather my thoughts and put them on the slate.
Some background about Neha Joshi - I was born and brought up in Nashik. I pursued a BTech degree in &amp;ldquo;Computer Engineering&amp;rdquo; from COEP (College of Engineering, Pune). I worked with Persistent Systems for ~11 months.</description>

      <description>Let us give a simple thought to this question:
 &amp;ldquo;How many times have you debugged some issue today?&amp;rdquo;
 You would be surprised that the number will be quite large than what you had initially expected. Debugging is such an important skill to possess.
May it be:  -The setup which is not working -Unable to connect to Zoom meetings (this has become a new way of working in this quarantine period) -VNC session not getting connected -Bluetooth not getting connected to the speaker  And countless other experiences!</description>

      <description>I came across this amazing Udemy course by Chris Croft. I am not into managerial role. But I wanted to have knowledge about the essentials of leadership. So I took up this course and I was very impressed by all the points which were put across during the course. Sharing some points which I had taken while persuing the course. I hope you find it useful :)
Leadership skills: leader vs manager  [-] Leader more about getting things done [-] Manager more about motivation and knowing what ppl wants etc.</description>
