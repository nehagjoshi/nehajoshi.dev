    <p class="lead">Sneak peak into my mould</p>
    <p>Hello There!
Firstly, thanks for visiting my site. This is something which I was planning to do since a very long time. Finally this lockdown due to &ldquo;Covid-19&rdquo; has helped me gather my thoughts and put them on the slate.</p>
<h4 id="some-background-about-neha-joshi--">Some background about Neha Joshi -</h4>
<p>I was born and brought up in Nashik. I pursued a BTech degree in &ldquo;Computer Engineering&rdquo; from COEP (College of Engineering, Pune). I worked with Persistent Systems for ~11 months. The only good thing that happened there was that I got introduced to my new found love - <strong>C</strong>. I had written lots of C programs during my engineering, but I was always focussed on having a career in Java (which was a very hot language at that time). Because of that new found love, I applied at NVIDIA Corporation and got selected after ~2 days of interviewing.</p>
<p>I currently work with NVIDIA (just completed 9 years with NVIDIA). At NVIDIA, I worked with the CUDA Developer-tools team for ~6 years and then thought of trying my hand on something new. So I switched my team and now I am a part of the Grid-SW team for ~3+ years. The GRID-SW team works on para-vitualizing the NVIDIA driver stack.</p>
<p>My hobbies include Reading, Playing Counter Strike with my team mates, Cooking (this is a new hobby which I have been forced to develop during the quarantine period) and programming, cycling (or basically anything that can keep me fit and healthy). I see myself becoming a full time teacher whenever I get the chance.
I am fortunate to have a very intelligent, passionate and supportive husband (<a href="https://vedang.me/">Vedang Manerikar</a>) who compliments my personality in every possible way and gives me something new to think about, whenever I have a discussion with him about Computer science.</p>
<p>I believe we are always in a learning phase all throughout our life. I intend to add to the collection of my blogposts everytime I learn something new.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking out time to read this very huge essay :) I hope our paths cross some day and we get to learn new things from each other!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
