I came across this amazing Udemy course by Chris Croft. I am not into managerial role. But I wanted to have knowledge about the essentials of leadership. So I took up this course and I was very impressed by all the points which were put across during the course. Sharing some points which I had taken while persuing the course. I hope you find it useful :)


## Leadership skills:
# leader vs manager

- [-] Leader more about getting things done
- [-] Manager more about motivation and knowing what ppl wants etc.
- [-] A good manager needs to be a good leader and vice versa

# A Leader's responsibility

- [-] Do the main work for sure. Anything else is good to have.
- [-] Train ppl for tasks which is not necessarily to be done by the captain
- [-] Have a system in place
- [-] Keep the ppl appreciated and motivated
- [-] Make sure to check on quality from time to time
- [-] A good boss is the one who is in control, builds a machine of people
- [-] Got to work in 3 areas: people, systems and vision
- [-] The manager is always responsible for everything that happens in the team

# Everything is management's fault

- [-] Management is responsible for any and every mistake/actions knowingly/unknowingly committed by the employee.
- [-] If you have the right people and the right monitoriting in place, you are okay.

# Methods of Monitoring

- [-] Management by wandering about (MBWA). Walk around the whole office every day. Have a real feel for what's happening. communication is very important
- [-] Back to the floor: for a stipulated time per year, try to go back to the basic job and try doing it. No need to be secretive. Better decision making due to this experience.

# Communication
- [-] Information cascade: Pass down at every level
- [-] Team meetings
- [-] Addressing the troops: Eg. All hands. Makes ppl feel part of something big.
- [-] He who communicates, leads

# Leadership: born or made?
- [-] Depends on what you do, not what you are.
- [-] Anybody can be a good leader if you know the right thing to do
- [-] Action centered leadership:
-  |==== (a) Work gets done
-  |==== (b) Team is happy
-  |==== (c) Individuals are happy
- [-] Stages in which tasks need to be done:
-  |==== (a) Setting objective
-  |==== (b) Planning
-  |==== (c) Briefing
-  |==== (d) Action
        
## MOTIVATION:

# Maslow's hierarchy of needs:
- [-] Physiological Needs
- [-] Safety/security
- [-] Belonging
- [-] Esteem/status
- [-] Self actualization

# The Management Potato
- [-] Thanking people is very important
- [-] Potato of performance:
- |==== (a) Good performance
- |==== (b) expert
- |==== (c) needs improvement
- [-] Manager should focus on all the areas
- [-] Can use shit sandwich while talking about improvement
- [-] Good-bad-good news
- [-] Help them what can be done differently next time for the "needs improvement" areas. Be positive about it.

# Types of people
- [-] Peoples personalities vary.
- [-] Need to adapt to the different personalities              
- [-] Manage peopledepending on which type they fall into

# Is money a motivator?        
- [-] Mostly No
- [-] Self-actualization and status has nothing to do with money, even though it may bring security
- [-] Money is a push motivator, not a pull motivator. i.e. It will make you do things, but will not make you want to do things
- [-] Below a point it works
- [-] Pay increase has only a short term effect. It makes an individual think that they got it just because they must be doing a good job.
- [-] Praise + Money is more effective than just Money
- [-] For creative tasks, more money == Less output. Thats because money distracts you from the task. It replaces the motivation.
- [-] Money matters are always unfair
- [-] Better to motivate people with other factors than Money
- [-] Worth thinking: Will you do a better job at work if you are silently paid more?
- |==== YES: That means you are not performing your best currently
- |==== NO : That means money is not a motivator for you
