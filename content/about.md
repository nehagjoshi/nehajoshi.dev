Hello There!
Firstly, thanks for visiting my site. This is something which I was planning to do since a very long time. Finally this lockdown due to "Covid-19" has helped me gather my thoughts and put them on the slate.

#### Some background about Neha Joshi - 

I was born and brought up in Nashik. I pursued a BTech degree in "Computer Engineering" from COEP (College of Engineering, Pune). I worked with Persistent Systems for ~11 months. The only good thing that happened there was that I got introduced to my new found love - **C**. I had written lots of C programs during my engineering, but I was always focussed on having a career in Java (which was a very hot language at that time). Because of that new found love, I applied at NVIDIA Corporation and got selected after ~2 days of interviewing.

I currently work with NVIDIA (just completed 9 years with NVIDIA). At NVIDIA, I worked with the CUDA Developer-tools team for ~6 years and then thought of trying my hand on something new. So I switched my team and now I am a part of the Grid-SW team for ~3+ years. The GRID-SW team works on para-vitualizing the NVIDIA driver stack.

My hobbies include Reading, Playing Counter Strike with my team mates, Cooking (this is a new hobby which I have been forced to develop during the quarantine period) and programming, cycling (or basically anything that can keep me fit and healthy). I see myself becoming a full time teacher whenever I get the chance.
I am fortunate to have a very intelligent, passionate and supportive husband ([Vedang Manerikar](https://vedang.me/)) who compliments my personality in every possible way and gives me something new to think about, whenever I have a discussion with him about Computer science.

I believe we are always in a learning phase all throughout our life. I intend to add to the collection of my blogposts everytime I learn something new.

Thank you for taking out time to read this very huge essay :) I hope our paths cross some day and we get to learn new things from each other!

Cheers!
